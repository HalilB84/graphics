TODO:
- ~~Book 1 (rust)~~
- ~~Book 2 (rust)~~
- learnopengl -> also learncpp at the same time with notes and the rustbook
- book 3 (rust) -> missing mathematical foundation, not sure what to do
- gpu tracing (full screen quad fragment shader, requires learning wgpu/webGPU?, wgsl) 
- vulkan (rust) -> I assume at this point I can latch onto something more

- Notes for the entirety of scratchapixel for how things work
- Somehow learn/relearn calc 1, 2, 3, linear algebra, Probability and stats, all sorts of math for graphics + machine/deep learning
